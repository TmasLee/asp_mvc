# asp_mvc

A small web app project built using C#, ASP.NET Core, and JS/React.

### **To-Do**:
* Accept friend request - update list in modal 

* Add friend
* Delete friend 

* Update image/avatar
* Generic repository - Parameterized table name - What is "persistence layer"?
* Add indexes --> Update queries?
* Generate real names
* Pic lol

* DB constraints through postman - can i add/request myself through postman? Users add/request each other multiple times?
* Why using composite key? Why use composite index?
* Format SQL in code
* AirBnb JS style
* MS or Google C# style

* Test xss / sql injection
* Web server logging

* Set up SSL
* Dockerize
* Set up prod environment / db connection string / salt / token payload
* Deploy script - Deploy to AWS ECS? - Inject secrets in appsettings.Development / secrets.json

### **Improvements To-Do**
* Logout redirect / Log out + Unauthorized message
* Request badges
* Only friends can view each others pages?
* Can probably make modals and UserLink/RequestLink more generic/reusable
* Better way instead of keyless entity to get join result?
* Smarter requests for friends/requests (there's probably a better way to pass currentUserId)
* Forgot password
* Get CSRF token on app level
