# asp_mvc

A portfolio-like project where I build a single page app from the ground up using a C# backend, a JS/React frontend, and everything I learned from work.

Eventually this web app will be used for ML practice using PyTorch.

### **To-Do**:

* Convert controllers to ApiControllers?
* Exercises
 * OOP
 * Design patterns
* MSSQL
* Deploy to AWS
 * ECS? Secrets
 * Set up SSL
 * Dockerize
