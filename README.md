# asp_mvc

A portfolio-like project where I build a web app from the ground up using a C# backend, a JS/React frontend, and everything I learned from work.

Eventually this web app will be used for ML practice using PyTorch.

### **To-Do**:

* Hook up backend to front end
 * Return html from backend 
 * Add script tag to html for module
 * Set up nav bar - static navbar - page content loaded dynamically
* Set up back-end API
* MSSQL
* Set up SSL
* Dockerize
* Deploy to AWS
