                <p>Sup, my name is Thomas, and as you can probably tell, I'm Antonio's little brother.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>This site is a small project where I build a web app along with other sub-apps and programming exercises from the ground up using everything I learned while working.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>A little about this project, this is a SPA built with a C#/ASP.NET Core backend (combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi concepts) with a JS/ReactJS frontend.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>While using the dotnet template projects is practical, I figured that'd be too easy and it'd be harder to customize anything (AKA ripping out Razor Pages ðŸ¤®). So instead I opted to start (mostly) from scratch and configure everything myself.</p>
