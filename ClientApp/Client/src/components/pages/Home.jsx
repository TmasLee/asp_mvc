                    This is a small project I've been working on recently in my spare time to familiarize myself with .NET. This was built with React and
                    ASP.NET Core MVC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it would've been practical to use .NET template projects or other .NET and JS libraries, I figured I'd get a better learning
                    experience making everything (mostly) from scratch. I also wanted to create this project without conforming to use all of Microsofts web
                    development tools (like Razor and Blazor ðŸ¤®).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn't sure what I wanted to make for this site so I implemented features as I went. I ended up implementing features that I either
                    hadn't worked with before or hadn't directly implemented myself with a focus on learning C# and .NET. Some of these features include handling 
                    real time requests using sockets (via SignalR and the WebSocket API) and a user login system with some web security (JWTs and CSRF cookies).
                    Another focus for this project was experimenting with the implementation of some of these features and how the application states would be
                    managed on both the front and back end.
