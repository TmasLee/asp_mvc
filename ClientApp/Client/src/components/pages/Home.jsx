                <p>Welcome to SlothBook. This is a small project that implements user management and web security by hand for some C# and ASP.NET Core practice.</p>
                <p>
                    This was built with a ReactJS front end and a customized back end combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi. While using .NET template projects is practical, I figured I'd get a better learning experience by starting (mostly) from scratch.
                    Also, some custom configurations (like not using Razor Pages ðŸ¤®) are a bit easier to set this way.

                <p><i>**DISCLAIMER: This is still a WIP. There are a number of things that can be done in a smarter/cleaner way and a few things I'm still figuring out how to do with ASP.NET </i>ðŸ˜…. Not to worry, I'm figuring it all out ðŸ’ª.</p>
