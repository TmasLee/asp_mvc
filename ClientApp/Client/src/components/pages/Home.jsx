                <p>
                    This was built with a ReactJS front end and a customized back end combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi. While using .NET template projects is practical, I figured I'd get a better learning experience by starting (mostly) from scratch.
                    Also, some custom configurations (like not using Razor Pages ðŸ¤®) are a bit easier to set this way.
