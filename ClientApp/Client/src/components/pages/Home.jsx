                <p>Sup it's your boy Thomas. As you can probably tell, I'm Antonio's little brother. We engine together pretty much everyday.</p>
                <p>This is an experimental project of multiple SPAs all handled by the same backend in order to learn C# and ASP.NET Core.</p>
                <p>This was built combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi concepts and a custom ReactJS frontend.</p>
                <p>While using the .NET template projects is practical, I figured I'd get a better learning experience by starting (mostly) from scratch and configuring everything myself. Plus using the template project makes it harder to customize anything (like ripping out Razor Pages ðŸ¤®).</p>
