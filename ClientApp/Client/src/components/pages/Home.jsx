                <p>Welcome to my SPA. This is a learning project to practice C#, ASP.NET Core, and OOP principals.</p>
                <p>This was built with a custom ReactJS front end and a customized backend combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi concepts.</p>
                <p>While using .NET template projects is practical, I figured I'd get a better learning experience by starting (mostly) from scratch and configuring everything myself (like ripping out Razor Pages ðŸ¤®).</p>
