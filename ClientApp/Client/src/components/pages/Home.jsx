                Welcome friend.

            <p>
                This is a small project I've spent my plentiful spare time during the last months working on to familiarize myself with C#
                and the .NET framework. Nearly everything was hand built using React and a customized backend combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi
                to serve this SPA.
            </p>
            <p>
                While using .NET template projects and other .NET and JS libraries would've been practical, I figured I'd get a better learning experience
                trying my hand at "rebuilding the wheel(s)" from scratch. I also wanted to create this project without conforming to use all of Microsofts
                web development tools (like Razor and Blazor ðŸ¤®).
            </p>
            <p>
                For this site I wanted to implement features that I hadn't worked with before or directly implemented myself. These include 
                a (rudimentary) user system with basic security tokens/cookies (JWTs and CSRF cookie) as well as sending and processing real time
                requests via sockets (more specifically the Websocket API).
