                <p>Sup it's your boy Thomas. As you can probably tell, I'm Antonio's little brother. We engine together pretty much everyday.</p>
                <p>Welcome to my SPA. This is a learning project to practice C#, ASP.NET Core, and OOP principals.</p>
                <p>This was built with a custom ReactJS front end and a customized backend combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi.</p>
                <p>This project is an attempt to make a SPA with session cookie based user authentication with the aforementioned technologies.</p>
                <p>While using .NET template projects and framework/ORM "out-of-the-box" functionalities is practical, I figured I'd get a better learning experience by starting (mostly) from scratch. Some custom configurations (like ripping out Razor Pages ðŸ¤®) are a bit easier this way too.</p>
