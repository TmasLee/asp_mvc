                <p>Welcome to my SPA. This is a learning project where I implement user login and security by hand for some C# and ASP.NET Core practice.</p>
                <p>
                    This was built with a ReactJS front end and a customized back end combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi. While using .NET template projects is practical, I figured I'd get a better learning experience by starting (mostly) from scratch.
                    Also, some custom configurations (like not using Razor Pages ðŸ¤®) are a bit easier to set this way.
