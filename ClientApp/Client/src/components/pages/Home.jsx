            <p>Hey friend.</p>
            <p>This is a small project built with React and a customized backend combining ASP.NET Core MVC and WebApi that implements hand-coded user management and web security for some C# and ASP.NET Core practice.</p>
            <p>
                While using .NET template projects and other libraries is practical, I figured I'd get a better learning experience by trying my hand at "rebuilding the wheel" (mostly) from scratch.
                Also, some custom configurations (like ripping out Razor Pages ðŸ¤®) are a bit easier to set up this way.
            </p>

            <p><i>**DISCLAIMER: This is still a WIP. There are a number of things that can be done in a smarter/cleaner way and a few things I'm still figuring out how to do with ASP.NET </i>ðŸ˜…. 
                Don't worry, I'm figuring it all out ðŸ’ª.</p>
